This is a repo to help me understand and work through data structures and algorithms.

Problems come from 
* [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://github.com/ShreyasD/CrackingTheCodingInterviewSolutions/blob/master/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%2C%206th%20Edition%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf)
* [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://mimoza.marmara.edu.tr/~msakalli/cse706_12/SkienaTheAlgorithmDesignManual.pdf)

The problems are written in comments above the solution.
