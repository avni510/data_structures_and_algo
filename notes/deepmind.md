### DeepMind

* Tell me about yourself
  I'm currently a senior software engineer at Tempus which is a bio tech company. I'm currently on a team that creates software for
  our lab which sequences patient biopsies into DNA and RNA sequences.
  I formally studied Math and Economics at the University of Texas at Austin in college. 
  I then went on to work for 8th Light which is a software consulting firm. There I had about a year long apprenticeship. 
  During the apprenticeship I learned TDD, Design principles, and adapting to new languages and technologies frequently. 
  I then started client work. One of my major projects was working with a prominent design firm in Chicago to build a diabetes
  management iPhone app from scratch. So it was kinda like a startup within a large company. 
  Here I really learned how to build things rapidly. But also create software so it was flexible and could adapt under changing requirements.
  After 8th Light I joined Tempus which is where I'm at now. 

* Why Deepmind 
  It really excites me to have the possiblity of working at a company that is at the cutting edge of AI research and development. I believe
  AI has the ability to help solve a lot of the worlds challenges today and that really motivates me. I see the power of AI, but I'm also drawn
  to Deepmind because they have a focus on AI safety and realiability which I think is crucial. Additionally, I think it will be a great opportunity
  to combine my past skills in math and software engineering. 

* Why are you leaving your current role
  Over the past couple of months I've found that quality and sustainbility of the code base isn't a priority at Tempus.
  It's a part of the software process that I really enjoy and I think will pay off in the end. Instead we're usually 
  asked to create band aid patch solutions so the feature can be shipped as soon as possible. I will make suggestions
  for improvements in our code base but won't get alloted time to complete them.

## Questions To Ask
  - What kind of projects will I be working on?
  - What's the language?
  - Do you provide relocation support?
  - What's the work/life balance? 
  - What is Deepmind's thoughts on the loss of jobs that will occur with more powerful AI systems?
  - I'm sure if varies from project to project but how tight are deadlines?

## Job Description
Non-exhaustive examples of the types of work in the Research Platform team:

* Platform for testing and evaluating ML algorithms in various simulated environments
* Systems for easily logging, storing, searching, and analyzing large quantities of experiment data
* Bespoke internal project management systems for organizing research at scale
* DevOps for DeepMind’s massive computational resource pool (consisting of TPUs, GPUs, and CPUs)
* Customizing TensorFlow at the language & compiler level for DeepMind’s use cases
* Massively parallel distributed scheduling system for machine learning experiments

## My Background
* Apprenticeship
  - Learned software principles
  - Had 2 mentors assigned to met
  - Heavily focused on TDD, SOLID Principles, and switching languages
  - My schedule usually consisted of writing blogposts to synthesize my learning, reading books on software principles, and working on projects
  - Presentations on technical topics 
  - Some major projects 
      - Writing a tic tac toe game with an unbeatable computer
      - Writing an HTTP Server
      - Creating an ebay clone app
* Trading Company
  - Worked with a team of developers to help them build a custom continuous deployment app
  - Written in Java
  - It was a large company so the ecosystem around the CD tool was very complex
* Diabetes App
  - Worked with a prominent design firm 
  - I worked with 3 developers and about 7 different designers and data scientists
  - This was like a startup within a large company
  - We would take the ideas from the designers and develop it into code
  - We had a tight deadline, so I learned how to build things rapidly, but also with flexibility and adaptability due to constant changing requirements. 
  - Some specifics I worked on:
    - Setting up environments with Terraform and Azure
    - Building out API integrations with our app
    - Building out an app to perform load testing
    - Building out major features in on our app
    - Quickly fixing bugs that came up in prod and deploying
    - Generative testing
