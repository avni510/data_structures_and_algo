#### Heaps

* Types of priority queues
* Priority queue is like a queue except it has some sort of ordering. 
* They contain partial ordering
* The ordering is not as strong as sorting, but is stronger than random ordering
* data is stored as an array of keys and the position of the keys to satisify the role
of pointers
* The left child is in position 2k and the right child is in position 2k + 1
* parent of k is k // 2
* It must be a complete binary tree (otherwise there would be gaps in the array)
