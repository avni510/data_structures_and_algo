### Machine Learning

# Gradient Descent
  - used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent 
  - used to update the parameters of a model

# Linear Regression
  - maps to continuous values ex: price

# Logistic Regression
  - used to assign to discrete set of classes (pass or fail)
  - returns probability which can then be mapped to discrete classes

# Supervised Machine Learning
  - you have input and output variables
  - you use an algorithm to learn the mapping
  - regression and classification are subgroups of supervised machine learning

# Unsupervised learning
  - you only have input data (no output data)
  - goal: model the underlying structure or distribution of the data. in order to learn more
  - clustering
    * discovering inherent groups
  - association
    * discover rules that describe large portions of your data. People that buy X also tend to buy Y

# Neural Networks
  - learn to perform a task by looking at training examples (generally labeled)
  - modeled loosely on the human brain
  - data moves through nodes, nodes are assigned weights
   
  input layer -> hidden layer -> output layer

  - learns by example
  - initially random data may come out, but it continues to adjust its weights until accurate results are reached

# Deep learning/ Deep Neural Network
  - the computer trains itself to process and learn from data
  - has more than 3 layers ex:
    * input layer
    * multiple hidden layers
    * output layer
