## 10.1 Sorted Merge: You are given two sorted arrays, 
# A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the
# end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.
def hello():
    return "WORLD"

## 10.2 Group Anagrams: Write a method to sort an array of strings 
# so that all the anagrams are next to each other.

## 10.3 Search in Rotated Array: Given a sorted array of n integers 
# that has been rotated an unknown number of times, write code to find 
# an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally 
# sorted in increasing order.

## 10.4 Sorted Search, No Size: You are given an array-like data structure Listy 
# which lacks a size method.It does, however, have an elementAt(i) method that 
# returns the element at index i in 0(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds of the 
# data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data structure only 
# supports positive integers.) Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, 
# find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may 
# return any index.

## 10.5 Sparse Search: Given a sorted array of strings that is interspersed 
# with empty strings, write a method to find the location of a given string.

## 10.6 Sort Big File: Imagine you have a 20 GB file with one string per line. 
# Explain how you would sort the file.

## 10.7 Missing Int: Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, 
# provide an algorithm to generate an integer that is not contained in the file. 
# Assume you have 1 GB of memory available for this task.

## 10.8 Find Duplicates: You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, 
# where N is at most 32,000. The array may have duplicate entries and you do not know 
# what N is. With only 4 kilobytes of memory available, how would you print 
# all duplicate elements in the array?

## 10.9 Sorted Matrix Search: Given an M x N matrix in which each row and each 
# column is sorted in ascending order, write a method to find an element.

## 10.10 Rank from Stream: Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. 
# Periodically, you wish to be able to look up the rank of a number x 
# (the number of values less than or equal to x). Implement the data structures 
# and algorithms to support these operations.That is, implement the method 
# track (in t x), which is called when each number is generated, and the method 
# getRankOfNumber(int x) , which returns the number of values less than 
# or equal to X (not including x itself).

## 10.11 Peaks and Valleys: In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element 
# which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is an 
# element which is less than or equal to the adjacent inte- gers. 
# For example, in the array {5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6} are peaks and {S, 2} 
# are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating 
# sequence of peaks and valleys.
